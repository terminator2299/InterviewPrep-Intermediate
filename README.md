# 📘 Interview Prep - Intermediate

This repository contains essential data structures and algorithms (DSA) problems and solutions curated as part of my interview preparation journey.

The goal is to build a strong foundation in problem-solving by practicing common patterns such as arrays, strings, hash maps, recursion, and more — all implemented with clean and efficient Python code.

## 🎯 Purpose

- Strengthen core DSA concepts
- Prepare for coding interviews at top tech companies
- Maintain a personal reference for commonly asked problems
- Track progress and consistency through version control

## 📌 How to Use

- Browse and review problems by topic
- Understand the logic and approach behind each solution
- Practice regularly and build muscle memory
